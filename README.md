#### Python - OOP

<details>
<summary>Explain inheritance and how to use it in Python</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain and demonstrate class attributes & instance attributes</summary><br><b>

In the following block of code `x` is a class attribute while `self.y` is a instance attribute

```
class MyClass(object):
    x = 1

    def __init__(self, y):
        self.y = y
```
</b></details>

#### Python - Exceptions

<details>
<summary>What is an error? What is an exception? What types of exceptions are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>

```
#  Note that you generally don't need to know the compiling process but knowing where everything comes from
#  and giving complete answers shows that you truly know what you are talking about.

Generally, every compiling process have a two steps.
    - Analysis
    - Code Generation.

    Analysis can be broken into:
        1. Lexical analysis   (Tokenizes source code)
        2. Syntactic analysis (Check whether the tokens are legal or not, tldr, if syntax is correct)

               for i in 'foo'
                          ^
             SyntaxError: invalid syntax

        We missed ':'


        3. Semantic analysis  (Contextual analysis, legal syntax can still trigger errors, did you try to divide by 0,
          hash a mutable object or use an undeclared function?)

                 1/0
                ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

    These three analysis steps are the responsible for error handlings.

    The second step would be responsible for errors, mostly syntax errors, the most common error.
    The third step would be responsible for Exceptions.

    As we have seen, Exceptions are semantic errors, there are many builtin Exceptions:

        ImportError
        ValueError
        KeyError
        FileNotFoundError
        IndentationError
        IndexError
        ...

    You can also have user defined Exceptions that have to inherit from the `Exception` class, directly or indirectly.

    Basic example:

    class DividedBy2Error(Exception):
        def __init__(self, message):
            self.message = message


    def division(dividend,divisor):
        if divisor == 2:
            raise DividedBy2Error('I dont want you to divide by 2!')
        return dividend / divisor

    division(100, 2)

    >>> __main__.DividedBy2Error: I dont want you to divide by 2!
```
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Exception Handling and how to use it in Python</summary><br><b>

**Exceptions:** Errors detected during execution are called Exceptions.

**Handling Exception:** When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message.</br>
Exceptions can be handled using `try` and `except` statement in python.

**Example:** Following example asks the user for input until a valid integer has been entered. </br>
If user enter a non-integer value it will raise exception and using except it will catch that exception and ask the user to enter valid integer again.


```py
while True:
    try:
        a = int(input("please enter an integer value: "))
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Ops! Please enter a valid integer value.")

```

For more details about errors and exceptions follow this [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)

<details>
<summary>What is the result of running the following function?

```
def true_or_false():
    try:
        return True
    finally:
        return False
```
</summary><br><b>
False
</b></details>

#### Python Built-in functions

<details>
<summary>Explain the following built-in functions (their purpose + use case example):

  * repr
  * any
  * all</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between repr function and str?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the __call__ method?</summary><br><b>

It is used to emulate callable objects. It allows a class instance to be called as a function.

- Example code:

```
class Foo:
    def __init__(self: object) ->  None:
        pass
    def __call__(self: object) -> None:
        print("Called!")

f = Foo()
f()
```

- Result:

```
Called!
```

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Do classes has the __call__ method as well? What for?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What _ is used for in Python?</summary><br><b>

1. Translation lookup in i18n
2. Hold the result of the last executed expression or statement in the interactive interpreter.
3. As a general purpose "throwaway" variable name. For example: x, y, _ = get_data() (x and y are used but since we don't care about third variable, we "threw it away").
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is GIL</summary><br><b>
	Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a type of process lock which is used by python whenever it deals with processes. Generally, Python only uses only one thread to execute the set of written statements. This means that in python only one thread will be executed at a time
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Lambda? How is it used?</summary><br><b>

A <code>lambda</code> expression is an 'anonymous' function, the difference from a normal defined function using the keyword `def`` is the syntax and usage.

The syntax is:

```lambda[parameters]: [expresion]```

**Examples:**

* A lambda function add 10 with any argument passed.

```py
x = lambda a: a + 10
print(x(10))
```

* An addition function

```py
addition = lambda x, y: x + y
print(addition(10, 20))
```

* Squaring function

```py
square = lambda x : x ** 2
print(square(5))
```
Generally it is considered a bad practice under PEP 8 to assign a lambda expresion, they are meant to be used as parameters and inside of other defined functions.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Write a function to return the sum of one or more numbers. The user will decide how many numbers to use</summary><br><b>

First you ask the user for the amount of numbers that will be use. Use a while loop that runs until amount_of_numbers becomes 0 through subtracting amount_of_numbers by one each loop. In the while loop you want ask the user for a number which will be added a variable each time the loop runs.

```
def return_sum():
	amount_of_numbers = int(input("How many numbers? "))
	total_sum = 0
	while amount_of_numbers != 0:
		num = int(input("Input a number. "))
		total_sum += num
		amount_of_numbers -= 1
	return total_sum

#### Python - Lists

<details>
<summary>What is a tuple in Python? What is it used for?</summary><br><b>

A tuple is a built-in data type in Python. It's used for storing multiple items in a single variable.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>List, like a tuple, is also used for storing multiple items. What is then, the difference between a tuple and a list?</summary><br><b>

List, as opposed to a tuple, is a mutable data type. It means we can modify it and at items to it.

Don't use `append` unless you would like the list as one item.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to remove the first 3 items from a list?</summary><br><b>

<summary>How to check if all the elements in a given lists are unique? so [1, 2, 3] is unique but [1, 1, 2, 3] is not unique because 1 exists twice</summary><br><b>
</b>

There are many ways of solving this problem:<br>
<code># Note: :list and -> bool are just python typings, they are not needed for the correct execution of the algorithm. </code>

Taking advantage of sets and len:

```
def is_unique(l:list) -> bool:
    return len(set(l)) == len(l)
```

This one is can be seen used in other programming languages.

```
def is_unique2(l:list) -> bool:
    seen = []

    for i in l:
        if i in seen:
            return False
        seen.append(i)
    return True
```

Here we just count and make sure every element is just repeated once.

```
def is_unique3(l:list) -> bool:
    for i in l:
        if l.count(i) > 1:
            return False
    return True
```

This one might look more convulated but hey, one liners.

```
def is_unique4(l:list) -> bool:
    return all(map(lambda x: l.count(x) < 2, l))
```

<summary>What is List Comprehension? Is it better than a typical loop? Why? Can you demonstrate how to use it?</summary><br><b>

From [Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions): "List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.".

It's better because they're compact, faster and have better readability.

- For loop:

```
number_lists = [[1, 7, 3, 1], [13, 93, 23, 12], [123, 423, 456, 653, 124]]
odd_numbers = []
for number_list in number_lists:
    for number in number_list:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            odd_numbers.append(number)
print(odd_numbers)
```

- List comprehesion:

```
number_lists = [[1, 7, 3, 1], [13, 93, 23, 12], [123, 423, 456, 653, 124]]
odd_numbers = [number for number_list in number_lists for number in number_list if number % 2 == 0]
print(odd_numbers)

<summary>What empty <code>return</code> returns?</summary><br><b>
</b>

Short answer is: It returns a None object.

We could go a bit deeper and explain the difference between

```
def a ():
    return

>>> None
```

And

```
def a ():
    pass

>>> None
```
Or we could be asked this as a following question, since they both give the same result.

We could use the dis module to see what's going on:

```
  2           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (<code object a at 0x0000029C4D3C2DB0, file "<dis>", line 2>)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 ('a')
              4 MAKE_FUNCTION            0
              6 STORE_NAME               0 (a)

  5           8 LOAD_CONST               2 (<code object b at 0x0000029C4D3C2ED0, file "<dis>", line 5>)
             10 LOAD_CONST               3 ('b')
             12 MAKE_FUNCTION            0
             14 STORE_NAME               1 (b)
             16 LOAD_CONST               4 (None)
             18 RETURN_VALUE

Disassembly of <code object a at 0x0000029C4D3C2DB0, file "<dis>", line 2>:
  3           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
              2 RETURN_VALUE

Disassembly of <code object b at 0x0000029C4D3C2ED0, file "<dis>", line 5>:
  6           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
              2 RETURN_VALUE
```

An empty <code> return</code> is exactly the same as <code>return None</code> and functions without any explicit return
will always return None regardless of the operations, therefore


```
def sum(a, b):
    global c
    c = a + b

>>> None

#### Python - Linked List

<details>
<summary>Can you implement a linked list in Python?</summary><br><b>

The reason we need to implement in the first place, it's because a linked list isn't part of Python standard library.<br>
To implement a linked list, we have to implement two structures: The linked list itself and a node which is used by the linked list.

Let's start with a node. A node has some value (the data it holds) and a pointer to the next node

```
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

Now the linked list. An empty linked list has nothing but an empty head.

```
class LinkedList(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```

Now we can start using the linked list

```
ll = Linkedlist()
ll.head = Node(1)
ll.head.next = Node(2)
ll.head.next.next = Node(3)
```

What we have is:

----       -----      ----
| 1 | ->   | 2 |  ->  | 3 |
----       -----      -----

Usually, more methods are implemented, like a push_head() method where you insert a node at the beginning of the linked list

```
def push_head(self, value):
    new_node = Node(value)
    new_node.next = self.head
    self.head = new_node
```
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Add a method to the Linked List class to traverse (print every node's data) the linked list</summary><br><b>

def print_list(self):
    node = self.head
    while(node):
        print(node.data)
        node = node.next
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Write a method to that will return a boolean based on whether there is a loop in a linked list or not</summary><br><b>

Let's use the Floyd's Cycle-Finding algorithm:

```
def loop_exists(self):
    one_step_p = self.head
    two_steps_p = self.head
    while(one_step_p and two_steps_p and two_steps_p.next):
        one_step_p = self.head.next
        two_step_p = self.head.next.next
        if (one_step_p == two_steps_p):
            return True 
    return False
```

```
@app.route('/')
def home():
  return 'main website'
```

- `add_url_rule` method: This is a method of the Flask class. We can also use it for map the URL with a function.

```
def home():

<summary>Explain what is a decorator</summary><br><b>
</b>
<b>In python, everything is an object, even functions themselves. Therefore you could pass functions as arguments
for another function eg;

```
def wee(word):
    return word

def oh(f):
    return f + "Ohh"

>>> oh(wee("Wee"))
<<< Wee Ohh
```

This allows us to control the before execution of any given function and if we added another function as wrapper,
(a function receiving another function that receives a function as parameter) we could also control the after execution.

Sometimes we want to control the before-after execution of many functions and it would get tedious to write

<code> f = function(function_1())</code>
<code> f = function(function_1(function_2(*args)))</code>

every time, that's what decorators do, they introduce syntax to write all of this on the go, using the keyword '@'.
</b>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can you show how to write and use decorators?</summary><br><b>

<code>
These two decorators (ntimes and timer) are usually used to display decorators functionalities, you can find them in lots of
tutorials/reviews. I first saw these examples two years ago in pyData 2017. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lmCu8wz8ro&t=3731s</code>

```
Simple decorator:

def deco(f):
    print(f"Hi I am the {f.__name__}() function!")
    return f

@deco
def hello_world():
    return "Hi, I'm in!"

a = hello_world()
print(a)

>>> Hi I am the hello_world() function!
    Hi, I'm in!
```

This is the simplest decorator version, it basically saves us from writting <code>a = deco(hello_world())</code>.
But at this point we can only control the before execution, let's take on the after:

```
def deco(f):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Rick Sanchez!")
        func = f(*args, **kwargs)
        print("I'm in!")
        return func
    return wrapper

@deco
def f(word):
    print(word)

a = f("************")
>>> Rick Sanchez!
    ************
    I'm in!
```

deco receives a function -> f
wrapper receives the arguments -> *args, **kwargs

wrapper returns the function plus the arguments -> f(*args, **kwargs)
deco returns wrapper.

As you can see we conveniently do things before and after the execution of a given function.

For example, we could write a decorator that calculates the execution time of a function.

```
import time
def deco(f):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        before = time.time()
        func = f(*args, **kwargs)
        after = time.time()
        print(after-before)
        return func
    return wrapper

@deco
def f():
    time.sleep(2)
    print("************")

a = f()
>>> 2.0008859634399414
```

Or create a decorator that executes a function n times.

```
def n_times(n):
    def wrapper(f):
        def inner(*args, **kwargs):
            for _ in range(n):
                func = f(*args, **kwargs)
            return func
        return inner
    return wrapper

@n_times(4)
def f():
    print("************")

a = f()

>>>************
   ************
   ************
   ************
```
