## Length

1. How to print the length of the string 'abcd' ?
2. How to print the length of the variable x (x is the list [5, 30 ,2]) ?
3. What would be the length of following dictionary {'x': 3, 'y': 3} ?
4. What would be the length of the tuple ('x', 'y') ?

## Solution

1. To print the length of the string 'abcd', you can use the len() function in Python:
  
  string = 'abcd'
  print(len(string))
  
  Output:
  4
  
2. To print the length of the variable x, which is a list [5, 30, 2], you can also use the len() function:
   
   x = [5, 30, 2]
   print(len(x))
   
   Output:
   3

3.  The length of a dictionary represents the number of key-value pairs it contains. In this case, the dictionary {'x': 3, 'y': 3} has two key-value pairs.
    To determine its length, you can use the len() function:
    
    dictionary = {'x': 3, 'y': 3}
    print(len(dictionary))
    
    Output:
    2
  
4.  The length of a tuple represents the number of elements it contains. In this case, the tuple ('x', 'y') has two elements. 
    You can use the len() function to obtain its length:
    
    tuple_var = ('x', 'y')
    print(len(tuple_var))
    
    Output:
    2
