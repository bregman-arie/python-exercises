## Inheritance

Explain what is inheritance and how does it work in Python

### Solution

By definition inheritance is the mechanism where an object acts as a base of another object, retaining all its
properties.

So if Class B inherits from Class A, every characteristics from class A will be also available in class B.
Class A would be the 'Base class' and B class would be the 'derived class'.

This comes handy when you have several classes that share the same functionalities.

The basic syntax is:

class Base: pass

class Derived(Base): pass

A more forged example:

class Animal:
    def __init__(self):
        print("and I'm alive!")

    def eat(self, food):
        print("ñom ñom ñom", food)

class Human(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        print('My name is ', name)
        super().__init__()

    def write_poem(self):
        print('Foo bar bar foo foo bar!')

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        print('My name is', name)
        super().__init__()

    def bark(self):
        print('woof woof')


michael = Human('Michael')
michael.eat('Spam')
michael.write_poem()

bruno = Dog('Bruno')
bruno.eat('bone')
bruno.bark()

>>> My name is  Michael
>>> and I'm alive!
>>> ñom ñom ñom Spam
>>> Foo bar bar foo foo bar!
>>> My name is Bruno
>>> and I'm alive!
>>> ñom ñom ñom bone
>>> woof woof

Calling super() calls the Base method, thus, calling super().__init__() we called the Animal __init__.

There is a more advanced python feature called MetaClasses that aid the programmer to directly control class creation.
